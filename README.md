#Exercise 1 : Linear Regression 


=========== PREDICTING PROFITS FOR A FOOD TRUCK ===========

Problem : Being the CEO of a restaurant franchise you are considering
	  different cities for opening an outlet. Select which cities
	  to expand to next.

Data Set : A previous food chain in various cities have the profits 
	   based on the population of the cities.

X : population

y : profits


=========== PREDICTING PRICES OF HOUSES ===========

Problem : Suppose you are selling your house and want to
	  know a good market price.

Data Set : Recent houses sold and their prices in Portland, Oregon.

X : Size of the house; Number of bedrooms

y : Price of House

#Exercise 2 : Logistic Regression 

=========== PREDICTING ADMISSION OF A STUDENT ============

Problem : Suppose you are administrator of university and want to 
	  determine each applicant's chance of admission.

Data Set : Previous applicants results based on two exam scores.

X : Exam score 1; Exam score 2

y : Result

#Exercise 3 : Multi-Class and Neural Network feedforward

=========== RECOGNIZING HANDWRITTEN DIGITS ============

Problem : To predict the digit written with the given parameters.

Data Set : Images of handwritten digits

X : Pixels of the handwritten digit image

y : Digits in range 0-9

#Exercise 4 : Neural Network Backpropagation

=========== RECOGNIZING HANDWRITTEN DIGITS ============

Problem : To predict the digit written by learning parameters
          through the algorithm.

Data Set : Images of handwritten digits

X : Pixels of the handwritten digit image

y : Digits in range 0-9

#Exercise 5 : Bias - Variance

======== PREDICTING WATER FLOWING OUT OF A DAM ===========

Problem : Predict the amount of water ﬂowing out of a dam 
	  using the change of water level in a reservoir.

Data Set : Historical records of the dam

X : Changes in water level

y : Amount of water flowing

#Exercise 6 : Support Vector Machines

============= SPAM CLASSIFIER ==============

Problem : Provide spam ﬁlters that are able to classify emails
	  into spam and non-spam email with high accuracy.

Data Set : Spam and Non-Spam Emails

X : Email

y : Spam or Non-Spam

#Exercise 7 : K-Means Clustering and PCA

============= COMPRESSING AN IMAGE ==============

Problem :  image compression by reducing the number 
	   of colors that occur in an image to only those
	   that are most common in that image.

Data Set : Images

X : 24-bit color representation of an image(16384 colors)

y : Image with colors reduced to 16

============ DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION ==============

Problem :  Applying dimensionality reduction in face images
	   using principal component analysis(PCA)

Data Set : Images

X : 32 x 32 pixel face images in grayscale

y : Image with colors reduced to 16

#Exercise 8 : Anomaly Detection and Recommender System

============ DETECTING ANOMALIES ==============

Problem : To detect anomalous behavior in server computers.

Data Set : Performace of Normal server computers

X : Throughput; Latency

============ BUILDING A RECOMMENDER SYSTEM ==============

Problem : Recommending movies to users on sites such as IMDB 
	  or books on AMAZON.

Data Set : Movie Ratings

X : Movies and Users

y : Ratings given by users on a scale of 0-5
